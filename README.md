# tetris-js

A simple tetris game built using plain javascript.

Inspired by [this article](https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057).

The article has pretty spaghetti code imo, so I tried doing it in a way that makes more sense. But by the end I just wanted to get it over with, so some stuff is still very spaghetti like the score keeping lol...
