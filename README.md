# tetris-js

A simple tetris game built using plain javascript, focusing on more modern language features.

Inspired by [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057).

The linked article has pretty spaghetti code imo, so I tried doing it in a way that makes more sense. But by the end I just wanted to get it over with, so some stuff is still very spaghetti like the code organization and score keeping lol...
