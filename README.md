# tetris-js

A simple tetris game built using plain javascript, focusing on more modern language features.

Inspired by [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057), but with heavily modified and personalized code.

Some of the organization and score keeping code is a bit spaghetti though lol
